The _Rogue-Opcode_ game framework is a simple, cross-platform game development library written in Android Java. It is developed with accelerated development in mind. Simplicity of design, flexibility, ease of use, and time to market are major engineering constraints on the design of the framework.

In the past, the effort has been partly subsidized by the LSAMP and McNair programs as a research project at San Diego State University.
